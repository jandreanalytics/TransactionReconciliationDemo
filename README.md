# Gift Card Transaction Reconciliation System

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in_development-yellow)

## Project Overview

This system identifies and analyzes discrepancies between point-of-sale and payment processor gift card transaction data. It demonstrates automated reconciliation techniques, error detection algorithms, and data quality visualization - core capabilities for ensuring financial data integrity in payment systems.

## Key Features

- 🔄 Multi-source transaction reconciliation with 25,000+ transaction volume
- 🔍 Advanced discrepancy detection algorithms across systems
- 📊 Interactive visualization dashboard for error pattern analysis
- 📋 Comprehensive error classification and reporting
- ⚙️ Configurable data quality rules engine

## Dataset Highlights

- **Synthetic Dataset**: Created to simulate both POS and processor sides of transactions (typically not available in a single dataset - especially not in a public context)
- **Transaction Volume**: 25,500 POS / 23,750 processor records
- **Financial Scope**: $304,696.16 POS / $308,041.75 processor total
- **Reconciliation Gap**: $3,345.59 net discrepancy
- **Error Distribution**:
  - Missing Transactions: 5.0% (1,250 records)
  - Decimal Shift Errors: 1.9% (475 records)
  - Double Charges: 2.0% (500 records)
  - Timing Mismatches: 4.7% (1,187 records)
  - Amount Discrepancies: 2.8% (712 records)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Generation

- Synthetic gift card transaction data with industry-standard formats
- 1,000+ unique gift cards with realistic patterns and activation timelines
- Multiple card number formats based on retail industry standards
- POS-to-processor transaction pairing with controlled error scenarios

### Reconciliation Engine

- Transaction matching using multi-field comparison algorithms
- Error categorization based on discrepancy patterns
- Timing validation with configurable tolerances
- Financial integrity validation with proper decimal handling

### Error Detection

- Missing transaction identification
- Decimal shift detection
- Timing mismatch analysis
- Double-charge detection
- Amount discrepancy classification

## Development Approach

This project was developed using a research-based approach:

1. **Research**: Analyzed real gift card formats, transaction patterns, and reconciliation challenges from industry documentation and retail examples
2. **Design**: Created data models that reflect actual financial system structures
3. **Implementation**: Built synthetic data generation with realistic error patterns
4. **Validation**: Ensured accuracy of financial calculations and reconciliation logic

### Development Methodology & Data Privacy

This project leverages modern development tools while focusing on core data quality principles:

- **Tool-assisted data generation**: GitHub Copilot was used to accelerate generation of synthetic test data and random patterns - areas outside the core focus of data reconciliation but necessary for demonstration purposes
- **Manual implementation of core logic**: The reconciliation algorithms, error detection patterns, and quality control mechanisms were manually implemented to ensure proper understanding of financial data integrity principles
- **Industry-focused approach**: The data generation serves only as a means to demonstrate the reconciliation capabilities, which are the true focus of this project and more aligned with real-world data quality analysis

All data is completely synthetic and programmatically generated. No transaction data of any kind was ever shared with AI tools - AI assistance was strictly limited to code implementation patterns while maintaining strict data privacy standards.
